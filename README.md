## Playing with react hooks

This is just a place to play around with React Hooks. Come play with me!

### React Hooks

React Hooks are an experimental proposal to React. You need at least React v16.7.0-alpha to use them.

If you don't know what a Hook is, check [the documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).
